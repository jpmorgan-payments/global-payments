# Global Payments Postman Collection

We have created a postman collection for each of the calls made on the showcase application.

## Using this collection against our sandbox environment

1. Import both the collection and environment into postman.
2. Navigate to [https://developer.payments.jpmorgan.com](https://developer.payments.jpmorgan.com) and login.
3. Create a new project
4. Within your project you will have a Client ID and Client Secret, paste these into the matching fields on the imported postman environment.
5. Click 'Get New Access Token' on postman.
6. Run any of the requests in postman collection.
